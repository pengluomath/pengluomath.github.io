I am an Associate Professor (Tenure-track) at the [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://math.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).
 
I graduated from the [Institute for Financial Studies](http://mathfinance.sdu.edu.cn/) at [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/) in 2016 and the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.mathematik.uni-konstanz.de/en/) at [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/) in 2015. My advisors are [Professor Shige Peng](http://en.mis.sdu.edu.cn/info/1184/1276.htm) and [Professor Michael Kupper](https://www.mathematik.uni-konstanz.de/stochastics-and-financial-mathematics/research/). My current research lies in stochastic analysis, stochastic control and mathematical finance.

I obtained my undergraduate degree from the [School of Mathematics at Shandong University](https://www.math.sdu.edu.cn/) in 2010.
